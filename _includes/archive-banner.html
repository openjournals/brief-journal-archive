    <strong>The Journal of Brief Ideas is currently in stasis and archived for now.</strong> 
    However, we are looking for technical help to restart. Code frameworks move on but the original site hasn't yet. 
    We are entirely volunteer run and don't currently have capacity for the update.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 10px;">
    If you think you could help, please see the 
    <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/brief-ideas/issues/219" class="alert-link" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> 
    for more information.
